# This is my python project I worked on by creating a magic 8 ball. This python program will generate a random number from 1-9 and has a pre defined question in it. Simply just remove the question, ask your question and replace the name variable with your name and this will work like a charm.

random_number = random.randint(1,9)

#print(random_number)

question = "Does the earth revolve around the sun?"

answer2 = "It is decidedly so"

answer5 = "Ask again later"
answer6 = "Better not tell you now"
answer7 = "My sources say no"
answer8 = "Outlook not so good"
answer9 = "Very doubtful"


print(name, "ask:", question)
